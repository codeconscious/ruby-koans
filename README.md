# Ruby Koans

I decided to complete the [Ruby Koans](https://www.rubykoans.com/), which I found recommended by several folks online. While lot of it served as a basic reminder of how things work in Ruby, the small class-modification tasks in particular were nice small exercises. This proved to be a good exercise to start 2024.

Side note: I learned during this that the word "koan" originates from the Japanese term "公案"!
